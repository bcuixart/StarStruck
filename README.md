# Star Struck
Simple game I am making to try out Raylib.
You play as a rocketship that constantly spins. Whenever you press space, the rocket stops spinning and accelerates forward. When the key is released, it decelerates and continues spinning. There is inertia which makes it challenging to move.

The map is infinite, with obstacles that must be dodged and stars to collect.

Thanks to the Raymob repository I have been able to turn this into a mobile app which I plan to eventually release.
